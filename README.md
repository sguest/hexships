## FAQ

### Why a hex grid?

Because [hexagons are the bestagons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY)

### Where are the letters and numbers beside the grid?

In a physical game, labelling the grid is critical to enable players to clearly communicate which square they're aiming at. In an electronic version of the game, however, you simply click/tap on the square you want and the computer takes care of the rest.

Also, mapping a coordinate system to a hexagonal grid is not entirely intuitive for a casual observer.
